# FC Bayern

Stream One Project - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This site will provide you with information about the German football club FC Bayern Munich, their trophy collection and their team, both players and coaches. Additionally, you can find their upcoming matches and a table of the German Bundesliga.

## Demo

Check it out with this Github link [here](https://alnibo.github.io/milestone-project-1/index.html).

## UX
The goal for this website was to provide information for anyone who is interested in and wants to find out more about the football club FC Bayern Munich. Besides a landing page, there are four separate pages providing different information about FC Bayern. The about page gives a description of the club and additionally states all titles that FC Bayern has collected over the years. The team site shows members of the whole team. They are categorised in goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards. Furthermore, the head coach and his assistance coaches are listed. The next page - fixtures - gives an overview of upcoming matches. The last page contains a table with the standings of all teams of the 2019/2020 German Bundesliga.

A modern look with light colors and a simple desgin was chosen in order to present the information in a clear and easy way.

As a first step [wireframes](https://github.com/alnibo/milestone-project-1/tree/master/wireframes) were designed to visualise and give an outline of the structures and layouts.

## Features

1. With its responsive design using the Bootstrap Grid system, this website was build for all screen sizes - from mobile to desktop screens. 
2. The navbar is fixed to the top and collapses when in mobile use.
3. Footer with Font awesome icons for the social media links
4. Pictures of team members with hover effect.

### Features Left to Implement
As the website now only provides a static table the next step would be to integrate a dynamic table that updates itself when new games have been played. On top of this, another good expansion would be the integration of standings in other leagues Bayern playes in. These include for example the Champions League and the German Cup.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)

## Testing

As part of the testing procedure this website was tested with https://validator.w3.org/. A few errors due to boostrap were displayed.

All links to the social media site where manually tested and it was made sure that these links will open in a new tab using `target="_blank"`.

Ensuring its responsiveness this website was tested across different mobile devices. In a second step it was then tested across the most common internet browsers, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Firefox), making sure it is compatible.

## Deploment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. 

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/alnibo/milestone-project-1` into your terminal.
