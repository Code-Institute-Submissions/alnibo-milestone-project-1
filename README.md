# FC Bayern

Stream One Project - User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This site will provide you with information about the German football club FC Bayern Munich, their trophy collection and their team, both players and coaches. Additionally, you can find their upcoming matches and a table of the German Bundesliga.

## Demo

Check it out with this Github link [here](https://alnibo.github.io/milestone-project-1/fixtures.html).

## UX
The goal for this website was to provide information about the foo for anyone who is interested in and wants to find out more about the football club FC Bayern Munich. Besides a landing page, there are four separate pages providing different information about FC Bayern. The about page gives a description of the club and additionally states all titles that FC Bayern has collected over the years. The team site shows members of the whole team. They are categorised in goalkeepers, defenders, midfielders and forwards. Furthermore, the head coach and his assistance coaches are listed. The next page - fixtures - gives an overview of upcoming matches. The last page contains a table with the standings of all teams of the 2019/2020 German Bundesliga.

## Features
With its responsive design using the Bootstrap Grid system, this website was build for all screen sizes - from mobile to desktop screens. 

The navbar is fixed to the top and collapses when in mobile use.

Footer with Font awesome icons for the social media links

Pictures of team members with hover effect.

### Features Left to Implement
As the website now only provides a table for the German Bundesliga it would be good to expand it with standings in other leagues Bayern playes in. These include for example the Champions League and the German Cup.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
